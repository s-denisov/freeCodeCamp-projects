    <header>Class based vs. prototype-based languages</header>
    <p>Class-based object-oriented languages, such as Java and C++, are founded on the concept of two distinct entities: classes and instances.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A class defines all of the properties that characterize a certain set of objects (considering methods and fields in Java, or members in C++, to be properties). A class is abstract rather than any particular member in a set of objects it describes. For example, the <code>Employee</code> class could represent the set of all employees.</li>
      <li>An instance, on the other hand, is the instantiation of a class; that is, one of its members. For example, <code>Victoria</code> could be an instance of the <code>Employee</code> class, representing a particular individual as an employee. An instance has exactly the same properties of its parent class (no more, no less).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A prototype-based language, such as JavaScript, does not make this distinction: it simply has objects. A prototype-based language has the notion of a <i>prototypical object</i>, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object. Any object can specify its own properties, either when you create it or at run time. In addition, any object can be associated as the <i>prototype</i> for another object, allowing the second object to share the first object's properties.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Defining_a_class">
    <header>Defining a class</header>
    <p>In class-based languages, you define a class in a separate class <i>definition</i>. In that definition you can specify special methods, called <i>constructors</i>, to create instances of the class. A constructor method can specify initial values for the instance's properties and perform other processing appropriate at creation time. You use the <code>new</code> operator in association with the constructor method to create class instances.</p>
    <p>JavaScript follows a similar model, but does not have a class definition separate from the constructor. Instead, you define a constructor function to create objects with a particular initial set of properties and values. Any JavaScript function can be used as a constructor. You use the <code>new</code> operator with a constructor function to create a new object.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Subclasses_and_inheritance">
    <header>Subclasses and inheritance</header>
    <p>In a class-based language, you create a hierarchy of classes through the class definitions. In a class definition, you can specify that the new class is a <i>subclass</i> of an already existing class. The subclass inherits all the properties of the superclass and additionally can add new properties or modify the inherited ones. For example, assume the <code>Employee</code> class includes only the <code>name</code> and <code>dept</code> properties, and <code>Manager</code> is a subclass of <code>Employee</code> that adds the <code>reports</code> property. In this case, an instance of the <code>Manager</code> class would have all three properties: <code>name</code>, <code>dept</code>, and <code>reports</code>.</p>
    <p>JavaScript implements inheritance by allowing you to associate a prototypical object with any constructor function. So, you can create exactly the <code>Employee</code> â€” <code>Manager</code> example, but you use slightly different terminology. First you define the <code>Employee</code> constructor function, specifying the <code>name</code> and <code>dept</code> properties. Next, you define the <code>Manager</code> constructor function, calling the <code>Employee</code> constructor and specifying the <code>reports</code> property. Finally, you assign a new object derived from <code>Employee.prototype</code> as the prototype for the <code>Manager</code> constructor function. Then, when you create a new <code>Manager</code>, it inherits the <code>name</code> and <code>dept</code> properties from the <code>Employee</code> object.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Adding_and_removing_properties">
    <header>Adding and removing properties</header>
    <p>In class-based languages, you typically create a class at compile time and then you instantiate instances of the class either at compile time or at run time. You cannot change the number or the type of properties of a class after you define the class. In JavaScript, however, at run time you can add or remove properties of any object. If you add a property to an object that is used as the prototype for a set of objects, the objects for which it is the prototype also get the new property.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="The_employee_example">
    <header>The employee example</header>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Employee</code> has the properties <code>name</code> (whose value defaults to the empty string) and <code>dept</code> (whose value defaults to "general").</li>
      <li><code>Manager</code> is based on <code>Employee</code>. It adds the <code>reports</code> property (whose value defaults to an empty array, intended to have an array of <code>Employee</code> objects as its value).</li>
      <li><code>WorkerBee</code> is also based on <code>Employee</code>. It adds the projects property (whose value defaults to an empty array, intended to have an array of strings as its value).</li>
      <li><code>SalesPerson</code> is based on <code>WorkerBee</code>. It adds the <code>quota</code> property (whose value defaults to 100). It also overrides the <code>dept</code> property with the value "sales", indicating that all salespersons are in the same department.</li>
      <li><code>Engineer</code> is based on <code>WorkerBee</code>. It adds the <code>machine</code> property (whose value defaults to the empty string) and also overrides the <code>dept</code> property with the value "engineering"
    </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Creating_the_hierarchy">
    <header>Creating the hierarchy</header>
    <p>There are several ways to define appropriate constructor functions to implement the Employee hierarchy. How you choose to define them depends largely on what you want to be able to do in your application.</p>
    <p>This section shows how to use very simple (and comparatively inflexible) definitions to demonstrate how to get the inheritance to work. In these definitions, you cannot specify any property values when you create an object. The newly-created object simply gets the default values, which you can change at a later time.</p>
    <p>In a real application, you would probably define constructors that allow you to provide property values at object creation time (see More flexible constructors for information). For now, these simple definitions demonstrate how the inheritance occurs.</p>
    <pre><code>
function Employee() {
  this.name = '';
  this.dept = 'general';
}
    </code></pre>
